        In 1980,<b>physicist Tim Berners-Lee,</b>
        <i>contractor at CERN,</i> proposed and prototyped <s>ENQUIRE</s>, a system for CERN
        researchers
        to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3]
        Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and
        CERN
        data
        systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally
        adopted
        by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and
        put
        an
        encyclopedia first.

        The first publicly

        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the
        Internet
        by
        Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of
        HTML.
        Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized
        Markup
        Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
    </p>

    <P>
        HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into
        visual or
        audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these
        characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text
        elements
        are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features
        of
        early
        text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
        (Compatible
        Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by
        typesetters
        to
        manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested
        annotated
        ranges
        with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has
        been
        progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

    <p>
        Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet
        Engineering
        Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext
        Markup
        Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition
        to
        define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the
        NCSA
        Mosaic
        browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on
        successful
        prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late
        1993,
        suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]
    </p>
    <p>
        After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995
        completed
        "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future
        implementations
        should be based.[12]
    </p>
    <p>
        Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML
        specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web
        Consortium
        (W3C).[13] However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
        published in
        late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext
        Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and
        completed
        and
        standardized on 28 October 2014.[14]
